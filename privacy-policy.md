## Privacy Policy

Dark Mode Enabler is a browser extension that enables dark mode on any website. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our extension.

This extension does not collect or store any personal information. Any information collected by this extension will be used only to enable dark mode on the current website.

## Permissions Explained

### activeTab

The `activeTab` permission is utilized by our extension to allow users to change the display mode of the website they are currently viewing. This permission is activated only when the user interacts with the extension, ensuring minimal intrusion. It enables our extension to access the current tab so that user-selected display preferences (like enabling dark mode or grayscale) can be applied instantly and efficiently. The use of activeTab ensures that our extension does not have blanket access to all tabs or websites the user visits, thereby enhancing privacy and security. This permission is crucial for providing a responsive and user-centric service, where changes are made instantly based on user interaction.

### storage

The `storage` permission is required for our extension to save user preferences and settings. This includes saving the users' choices for website display modes, such as dark, sepia, or grayscale, which enhances the user experience by remembering their preferences across browsing sessions. The data saved is specific to the extension's functionality and is not used for any form of data tracking or external purposes. This permission ensures that users do not have to repeatedly set their preferences every time they open their browser or visit a website.

### host

The `host` permission is essential for our extension as it needs to modify the appearance (e.g., color scheme and filters) of the websites as per user preferences. This permission is used to inject CSS and apply the selected display modes (like dark mode or sepia) to the websites visited by the user. We ensure that the usage of this permission is strictly limited to applying visual changes as requested by the user and does not involve any form of data collection, ensuring privacy and security. This permission is critical for the core functionality of our extension as it allows us to enhance user experience on a wide range of websites.
